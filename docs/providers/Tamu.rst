Tamu
======
The Texas A&M Geoservices Geocoding API provides output including Lat and Lon
and numerous census data values.

An API key linked to an account with Texas A&M is required.

Tamu's API differs from the other geocoders in this package in that it
requires the street address, city, state, and US zipcode to be passed in
separately, rather than as a single string.  Because of this requirement,
the "location", "city", "state", and "zipcode" parameters are all required
when using the Tamu geocoder.
